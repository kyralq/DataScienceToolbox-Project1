## Reading order

All report content is in the directory Report/

The reading order of the content is:
* 01- (data stuff)
* 02- (regression model)
* 03- (SVM model)
* 04- (XGBoost model)
* 05- (Random forest model)
* 06-Wrapup.md

## Requirements

Requirements for the Rmd files are given within each script.

Requirements for each python file is given in individual requirements.txt files:
* `XGBoost-requirments.txt`
* 
* 

To install these, in a virtual environment run:
```{sh}
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
replacing the general requirments.txt with the specific file for that dataset.

## Description

In this project we have each built a classification model for the stroke dataset.
